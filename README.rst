Extract data from `APD news site <http://austintexas.gov/department/news/296>`_.

ScrAPD is a small utility designed to help organizations retrieving traffic fatality data in a friendly manner.

Installation
------------

ScrAPD requires Python 3.7+ to work.

::

  pip install scrapd

Quickstart
----------
Collect all the data as CSV::

  scrapd --format csv

By default, scrapd does not display anything until it is done collecting the data. If you want to get some feedback
about the process, you can enable logging, by adding the `-v` to the command you want to use. Multiple `-v`
options increase the verbosity. The maximum is 3 (`-vvv`)::

  scrapd -v --format csv

To save the results to a file, use the shell redirection::

  scrapd -v --format csv > results.csv

.. note::

  The logs are displayed to `stderr` and will not appear in the result file generated by the redirection. If you want to
  include this information add  `&2>1`.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Retrieve the traffic fatalities that happened between January 15th 2019 and January 18th 2019, and output the results
in `json`::

  scrapd --from "Jan 15 2019" --to "Jan 18 2019" --format json

Speed and accuracy
------------------

ScrAPD executes all the requests in an asynchronous manner. As a result it goes very fast.

It parses the information using both the text of the report itself and the Twitter tweet stored in the page metadata.
Combining these two methods provides a high degree of confidence in the parsing and allows us to reach more than
**95% of success rate**.

Some statistics:

* **100% of entries detected**
* 95% of entries correctly parsed

  * 5% of entries failed the parsing only **partially**
  * 0 complete failure

* processing time: ~2m00s for ~140 entries

Who uses ScrAPD?
----------------

The Austin `Pedestrian Advisory Council <http://austintexas.gov/cityclerk/boards_commissions/meetings/121_1.htm>`_
used ScrAPD to compile a detailed presentation of the status of the traffic deaths in Austin, TX:

* `2018 PAC retrospective presentation <http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=314367>`_

* `Walk Austin <http://www.walkaustintx.org/>`_
