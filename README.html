<p>By default, scrapd does not display anything until it is done collecting the data. If you want to get some feedback
about the process, you can enable logging, by adding the <cite>-v</cite> to the command you want to use. Multiple <cite>-v</cite>
options increase the verbosity. The maximum is 3 (<cite>-vvv</cite>):</p>

<p>ScrAPD executes all the requests in an asynchronous manner. As a result it goes very fast.</p>
<p>It parses the information using both the text of the report itself and the Twitter tweet stored in the page metadata.
Combining these two methods provides a high degree of confidence in the parsing and allows us to reach more than
<strong>95% of success rate</strong>.</p>
