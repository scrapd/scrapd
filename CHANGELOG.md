## [Unreleased]

## [[3.0.0]] - 2019-10-12

### Added

- Add CLI flag to dump reports with parsing errors on disk. This also adds helper functions and tests to simplify the
  debuging of the dumps. [#214]

### Changed

- The internal format was updated to allow automated data validation, prevent invalid values to injected in the data
  and handle multiple fatalities in one crash. New fields were added such as `middle name` or `generation`. [#199]

### Fixed

- Fixed parsing issues:
  - Fix parsing of `Location` field where its content ws merged with the next field.[#203]
  - Handle reports containing an `Arrested` field.[#204]
  - Handle `born` as a marker to extract the deceased date of birth. [#208]
  - Fix `Date` parsing regex. [#210]

## [[2.1.1]] - 2019-08-22

### Fixed

- Fixed parsing of crashes involving multiple deaths. [#178]

## [[2.1.0]] - 2019-07-17

### Added

- Add CLI flags to parametrize retries at runtime. [#159]
- Add tasks to do some profiling of the application. [#163]
- Improve logging ability by adding more details about a parsing failure. [#167]

### Changed

- Use [nox](https://nox.thea.codes) and [invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org) for task management execution instead of `make`.

### Fixed

  - to support date of birth with the following format `August 30, 1966`. [#155]
  - to support describing the age instead of the date of birth (i.e. `19 years of age`).[#172]
